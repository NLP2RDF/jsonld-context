##  JSONLD-CONTEXT

According W3C specifications, "when two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes place in a shared environment, typically called "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend, to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in JSON-LD works in the same way".


## WHAT IS JSONLD-CONTEXT.IO?

jsonld-context.io is a easy way to get your ontology in json-ld context.


## HOW?

```
"@context": "http://www.jsonld-context.io/api/v1?ontology=http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core"
```
